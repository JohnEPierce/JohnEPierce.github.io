        We tested a <b>new way</b> to run <b>community aphasia groups</b>.<br>
        People from the community were trained and then led the groups.<br>
        They had support from speech pathologists and other health professionals.<br>
        People with aphasia said the groups: 
            <ul style="font-size: inherit;">
                <li>helped them <b>connect</b> with others,</li>
                 <li>feel more confident, and </li>
                 <li>practise communication.</li>
            </ul>
        The groups worked well, but family members wanted more support too.

    <p>
    Community Aphasia Groups support long-term communication and social connection after stroke.<br>However, many groups close because they rely heavily on speech pathologists and ongoing funding.<br>
    Peer-led models may help groups run for longer and reach more people.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <strong>What we did</strong><br>
    We developed a model, where a small clinical "hub" provides guidance and occasional input to trained community members with and without aphasia to lead groups locally.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    We piloted two 12-week community aphasia groups using this model. Groups met weekly and some close others attended selected sessions. We collected communication outcomes and interviewed participants, facilitators, and close others to understand how the program worked and how it was experienced.

    <strong>What we found</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>The program was feasible and acceptable to people with aphasia, volunteers, and clinicians.</li>
        <li>Several participants showed meaningful improvements in communication-related quality of life and functional communication.</li>
        <li>Participants described increased confidence, purpose, social connection, and expanded roles within the groups.</li>
        <li>Close others valued the program but wanted more sessions focused on their own experiences and support needs.</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>What next?</strong><br>
        We are running a phase II pilot trial in Victoria, Australia. We've compared the peer-led groups to a control group. Results are currently being analysed!
