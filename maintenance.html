    <h1>Intensive aphasia therapy is effective when measured at <strong>group level</strong>, but many <strong>individuals</strong> do not respond significantly, and even fewer individuals <strong>maintain</strong> their initial gains.</h1>

    <p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 3rem;">We analysed 44 studies of intensive aphasia intervention (n=670 participants with post-stroke aphasia) by calculating individual-level  statistics. Only about one-third improved significantly immediately after intervention and only two-third of these maintained their improvements at follow-up. Thus, only <strong>22%</strong> of all participants improved significantly and maintained their therapy gains. <strong>This demonstrates the importance of maintenance activities.</strong>></p>

        <h3>Implications for rehabilitation</h3>
            <p>Only a small proportion (about one fifth in this review) of intensive aphasia treatment program participants respond and maintain their therapy gains, a fact that is obscured by traditional p-value group analysis.</p>
            <p>A simple clinical decision-making method is presented for evaluating individual therapy gains and their maintenance.</p>
            <p>For some immediate treatment responders (about one third in this review), gains from intensive therapy programs are unlikely to be maintained in the long-term without additional, ongoing practice.</p>
            <p>Clinicians should consider the possibility of individual clients losing some of their therapy gains and take proactive steps to support long-term maintenance.</p>
